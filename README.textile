h3. Pygmentify

A "Google App Engine":http://code.google.com/appengine/ app for serving "Pygments":http://pygments.org to non-Python environments (such as "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com)

h3. Usage

Requires a POST request containing the following parameters:

* _language_ - language to specify the lexer
* _body_ - the code to be formatted

It returns the HTML generated by Pygments HTMLFormatter, but stripped of the outer @<div>@ and @<pre>@ tags so it doesn't mess with your application layout - e.g. for grouping multiple @<pre>@ elements (you should add them manually).
  
h3. Access

This app is available at "pygmentify.appspot.com":http://pygmentify.appspot.com for public access.
